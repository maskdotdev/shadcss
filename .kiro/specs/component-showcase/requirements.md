# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive component showcase page that displays all available UI components in an organized, interactive format. The showcase will serve as both a documentation tool and a testing environment, allowing developers to view components, see code examples, and understand usage patterns. The page will display components from both the original shadcn/ui library and the new CSS modules version (shadcss-ui).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see all available components organized alphabetically in a sidebar navigation, so that I can quickly find and explore specific components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the showcase page loads THEN it SHALL display a sidebar with all components listed alphabetically
2. WHEN a component is listed THEN it SHALL show the component name and any underlying library dependencies (e.g., Radix UI, CMDK)
3. WHEN I click on a component in the sidebar THEN it SHALL navigate to that component's showcase section
4. WHEN viewing the sidebar THEN it SHALL be responsive and collapsible on mobile devices
5. WHEN components are listed THEN they SHALL include both original shadcn/ui and CSS modules versions where available

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see live examples of each component with different variants and states, so that I can understand how components look and behave.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a component THEN it SHALL display live rendered examples of the component
2. WHEN examples are shown THEN they SHALL include all available variants (size, color, state, etc.)
3. WHEN examples are shown THEN they SHALL demonstrate different use cases and configurations
4. WHEN components have interactive states THEN the examples SHALL be fully functional
5. WHEN components have animations or transitions THEN they SHALL be visible in the examples

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the source code for each component example, so that I can understand how to implement and use the components in my own projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a component example THEN it SHALL provide a code snippet showing the implementation
2. WHEN code is displayed THEN it SHALL be syntax highlighted and properly formatted
3. WHEN code is shown THEN it SHALL include import statements and any required dependencies
4. WHEN code is displayed THEN it SHALL be copyable to clipboard with a single click
5. WHEN multiple variants exist THEN each SHALL have its own code example

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see information about underlying libraries and dependencies, so that I can understand what external packages are required for each component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a component THEN it SHALL display information about underlying libraries (Radix UI, CMDK, etc.)
2. WHEN dependencies are shown THEN they SHALL include version information and links to documentation
3. WHEN a component uses multiple libraries THEN all dependencies SHALL be clearly listed
4. WHEN viewing dependencies THEN it SHALL show installation commands for required packages
5. WHEN components have peer dependencies THEN they SHALL be clearly identified

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to switch between original shadcn/ui components and CSS modules versions, so that I can compare implementations and choose the appropriate version for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both versions exist THEN it SHALL provide a toggle to switch between shadcn/ui and CSS modules versions
2. WHEN switching versions THEN the examples and code SHALL update to reflect the selected implementation
3. WHEN viewing different versions THEN the differences SHALL be clearly highlighted
4. WHEN only one version exists THEN it SHALL indicate which version is available
5. WHEN switching versions THEN the URL SHALL update to maintain deep linking capability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the showcase to be searchable and filterable, so that I can quickly find components that meet specific criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the showcase THEN it SHALL provide a search input to filter components by name
2. WHEN searching THEN it SHALL highlight matching text in component names and descriptions
3. WHEN filtering THEN it SHALL provide options to filter by component category or underlying library
4. WHEN no results match THEN it SHALL display a helpful "no results" message
5. WHEN search is active THEN it SHALL be clearable with a single action

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the showcase to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the layout SHALL adapt with collapsible sidebar and touch-friendly interactions
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible via keyboard
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN component information SHALL be properly announced
4. WHEN viewing examples THEN they SHALL maintain accessibility features of the original components
5. WHEN the page loads THEN it SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
