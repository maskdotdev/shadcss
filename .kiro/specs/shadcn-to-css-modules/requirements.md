# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves converting all existing shadcn/ui components from Tailwind CSS styling to CSS modules while maintaining the same functionality and visual appearance. The converted components will be organized in a new `shadcss-ui` directory structure with each component having its own folder containing both the TypeScript component file and its corresponding CSS module file.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use shadcn/ui components with CSS modules instead of Tailwind CSS, so that I can have more control over styling and avoid potential CSS conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component is converted THEN it SHALL maintain identical visual appearance and functionality
2. WHEN a component is converted THEN it SHALL be placed in `src/components/shadcss-ui/{component-name}/` directory
3. WHEN a component is converted THEN it SHALL have an `index.tsx` file and a `{component-name}.module.css` file
4. WHEN a component is converted THEN all Tailwind classes SHALL be replaced with CSS module classes
5. WHEN a component is converted THEN it SHALL export the same interface as the original component

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing shadcn/ui components to be converted systematically, so that I have a complete set of CSS module-based components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the conversion is complete THEN all 45 components from `src/components/ui/` SHALL have corresponding versions in `src/components/shadcss-ui/`
2. WHEN a component has variants THEN all variants SHALL be properly converted to CSS module equivalents
3. WHEN a component uses conditional styling THEN the logic SHALL be preserved using CSS module class combinations
4. WHEN a component imports other components THEN it SHALL import from the new shadcss-ui directory structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CSS modules to be well-organized and maintainable, so that I can easily customize and extend the components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS is generated THEN class names SHALL follow BEM or similar naming conventions
2. WHEN CSS is generated THEN it SHALL be organized with logical grouping of related styles
3. WHEN CSS is generated THEN it SHALL include CSS custom properties for easy theming
4. WHEN CSS is generated THEN it SHALL maintain responsive design patterns from the original Tailwind classes
5. WHEN CSS is generated THEN it SHALL preserve accessibility features and focus states

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the conversion process to be automated where possible, so that I can efficiently convert all components with consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting components THEN the existing conversion script SHALL be utilized and enhanced as needed
2. WHEN converting components THEN the process SHALL generate accurate CSS equivalents for Tailwind classes
3. WHEN converting components THEN component props and TypeScript interfaces SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN converting components THEN import statements SHALL be updated to reflect new file structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the converted components to integrate seamlessly with the existing project structure, so that I can use them as drop-in replacements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are converted THEN they SHALL work with the existing TypeScript configuration
2. WHEN components are converted THEN they SHALL work with the existing build process
3. WHEN components are converted THEN they SHALL maintain compatibility with React and Next.js
4. WHEN components are converted THEN external dependencies SHALL remain the same where possible
